pbar

Bash progress bar (pbar) script, which provides a progress bar and percentage
output to the console. There are many various configuration options to allow
the user to generate the desired output.

I couldn't find something that would do what I wanted, so I whipped up this
script. I've provided it here in case anyone might also find it useful, whether
in whole or in part. Enjoy!

Output Example:
$ pbar 50
[####################################-------------------------------------]  50%

There is also an inverted bar output type, which cannot be demonstrated in a
text file. This type just inverts the background color rather than using
characters to represent the progress bar.

The user will input a percentage from 0-100, not necessarily an integer. The
resolution of the resulting progress bar is dependent upon the width that is
used. The default width is 80 characters, with 73 or 75 characters dedicated
to actual progress indicators, depending on the output method used. There are
multiple options available for modifying the output width as desired.

Keep in mind that pbar isn't optimized for performance as a result of
supporting so many different options for configuration. Consider only using
parts of pbar or customizing it as you see fit to help you obtain the output
that is desired if pbar isn't meeting your performance specifications.
